# Graph Algorithm Simulator

## Project Overview
This project is a Graph Algorithm Simulator designed for educational purposes, specifically for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) subject in the 4th semester of B.Tech.

## Contributors
1. **Aditya Pandey** - HTML structure and layout, canvas setup, and event handling.
2. **Tanmay Sagar** - CSS styling and graph drawing logic.
3. **Kartik Bisht** - BFS and DFS algorithm implementations.
4. **Gaurang Joshi** - Dijkstra's algorithm implementation.

## Features
- Interactive graph creation by clicking on the canvas.
- Visualization of BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's algorithms.
- Dynamic edge weights and node connections.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click on the canvas to create nodes.
3. Click on two nodes to create an edge with a random weight.
4. Use the buttons to visualize BFS, DFS, or Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Technologies Used
