# Graph-Algorithm-Visualizer
This project, DAA-Graph-Algorithm-Visualizer, is an interactive tool designed for educational purposes, specifically for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) subject. It allows users to visualize and understand graph algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm.
